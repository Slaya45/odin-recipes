<h1> Lets get to making these things!</h1>
<h3> Step 1</h3>
<p> First crack your 2 warm eggs into a bowl and wisk them vigerously, 
    add your warm water *Note your water should be between 90ยบ and 110ยบ then add your yeast.
After youve mixed this all together add 1 cup of flour mix in cover with saran wrap or a towel and let rest for 20 mins.

<h3> Step 2</h3>
<p> Once the mixture has rested, add your salt and start adding the flour in 1/2 cup at a time. your, micture will slowly become a dough.
    When your mixture has become to hard to mix, you can spread some flour on a clean and dry surface to start kneading.
    Knead this doug until it had become fluffy and obsorbed all the flour. This should take 5-10mins.
</p>
<p> Once you are satisfied with your dough we can start to roll it out flat. Were going for a semi rectangular shape, this shape will help make eadch roll even and uniform.
  The rolled dough should be around 1/2inch thick when your complete.

<h3> Step 3</h3>
<p>
Grab yourself that .5 stick of melted butter and spread it ontop of the dough, its best to use a pastry brush. Next sprinkle some cinnamon sugar on top, you should use at least 3/4 cup you can
add more if you wish. Then you want to roll your dough into a cylinder, once you have done this, cut the dough into 6 equal parts. Set them onto a pan and put them into the oven. Cook for 30 mins at 325ยบ.
